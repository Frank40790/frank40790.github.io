              This is the first version of my website containing some of the
              projects I am working on. The website at this stage is still
              pretty barebone. I would like to add some new pages and projects
              onto this page in the future.
            </div>
            <div>
              You might see some of the projects and pages are not clickable
              yet. I am still working on those, and expecting to finish it in
              the near future.
